The problem to estimate the broadcast duration(time a node spends in re-transmission) in duty-cycled networks is formulated so as to capture the probability threshold of the same with a given lower error margin under real world conditions.
 
 Demonstrating the efficiency of our solution Using Matlab(Prowler) for the simulation.
